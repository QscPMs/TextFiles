# TextFiles
Text Files Recording

This folder is to store QSC PM's private files.

In the mean time, it is a way of collaboration.

Now there are several **brochures**:
+ 产品从-1到0傻瓜手册 ( your textbook about product)
+ 产品面试手册(The interview manual)
+ 面向管理的产品手册(The management guide)
+ 网节手册(Handbook about Network Festival)

Now there are several backup data:

+ 内训资料(training data)



Here are some **cautions you must follow**:

+ Never force-push !!
+ you'd better not delete some part directly without telling PM team. Otherwise you can use way like annotation to express your point of view.



Some tips you can use to obtain a better experience:

+ use `diff` command in Vscode to compare the difference between two files. It is really useful for our text(.txt, .md) editing. Just like git diff.



If you meet any problems, contact 剩女.



**Thank you for your contributions to make QSC PM better!**
